Graphics project 3 - dev

Nov 1, 2015

i. Have added a new file 'TransversalArc.pde' takes care of drawing arc given points on the avg curve, curve1 and curve2 as 3 array lists.

ii. Have added key 'g' to generate avg curve after modifying control points, because, generating avg curve in the draw loop made my system lag in displaying it.

iii. Have added key 't' to switch the display of transversal arc on or off. The green line is the arc. The orange line is the line joining the medial point and the points on the curve.

iv. Have added key 'v' to translate the camera in xy plane similar to 's' key functionality which zooms in and out.
